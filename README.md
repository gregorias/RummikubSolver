# ðŸ§© Rummikub Solver

This is a solver for [Rummikub][rummikub].

Don't know whether there is a winning move? Someone can't finish, has made a
mess on board, and can't retrieve original sets? Don't worry! Rummikub Solver
automatically finds the solution.

Rummikub Solver uses integer linear programming to find the solution which
maximizes the number of tiles placed on the table from the rack. You just need
to provide the current description of the state of the game. Rummikub Solver
will display possible sets that are achievable and tiles that may be placed to
achieve them.

## Installation

This section explains how you can install this application.

### Prerequisites

Rummikub Solver requires [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) for
compilation and execution. Here are package pointers to some selected
platforms:

| OS | Package |
| -- | ------- |
| Ubuntu | [libglpk-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/lunar/libglpk-dev) |
| Arch Linux | [glpk](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/glpk/) |
| MacOS | [Homebrew GLPK](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/glpk) |

### Download/Build

You can try fetching a built package or building a package yourself.

#### (Linux) Download from GitHub releases

If you are on Linux, check
[the releases tab](https://github.com/gregorias/rummikubsolver/releases) to
fetch a package for your platform.

#### Building from Source

In case there's no working built package for you, you can build one from source.

Firstly, install a Haskell toolchain.
This can be easily done with
[GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

Secondly, use Stack to build & install the package with:

```bash
stack build
stack install
```

## Usage

Shortly, run `rummikubsolver` and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Rummikub Solver has 2 UIs available: CLI and GUI. GUI is turned on by default
and uses [threepenny-gui](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/threepenny-gui)
to run a web interface. To use the GUI, visit `127.0.0.1:8080`.

You can run Rummikub Solver after installation by executing `rummikubsolver`.

Both interfaces use special syntax for adding or removing tiles from the table
or the rack. For example:

```plaintext
-lr1-3 // Remove (-) blue (l) and red (r) tiles of value from 1 to 3.
y10 // Add a yellow (y) 10 tile
j // Add a joker (j)
-j, b2 // Remove a joker (j) and add black (b) 2.
```

Formally the queries have following syntax:

```plaintext
QUERY ::= [-] (COLOR+ (VALUE | VALUE_RANGE) | j)
COLOR ::= [rlyb]
VALUE ::= 1-13
VALUE_RANGE ::= VALUE - VALUE
```

## Final remarks

This program was done to train my Rummikub skills and as a helping tool for
board game nights.
